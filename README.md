# El Nino/La Nina impacts on Global Coffee Prices and Production
### Purpose
Analyze how coffee prices have shown significant variation over the years, influenced by a variety of factors including market dynamics and possibly meteorological phenomena like El Nino and La Nina.  ​
### Key Objectives
* Identify coffee producing countries and top 10 producers.
* Compute total and yearly average production.
* Display Arabica and Robusta coffee prices fluctuation over the years.
* From coffee producing countries, how has El Nino/La Nina patterns impacted coffee prices?
* Show the correlation coefficient between yearly average coffee price and El Nino/La Nina patterns and their effect on coffee prices.
* Evaluate the correlation between El Nino/La Nina patterns and their effect on different types of coffee.
* Identify the countries that have been most impacted by irregular El Nino/La Nina patterns and how this meteorological phenomena has influenced production outputs.
### Key Findings
* Production data emphasizes the dominance of certain countries in coffee production, particularly Brazil.
* The correlation between coffee prices and the Oceanic Index suggests that while meteorological conditions may have some impact on coffee prices, they are likely not the sole influencing factor.
* Arabica coffee generally has a higher price than Robusta.
* The price of Arabica coffee beans shows more volatility over the years compared to Robusta.
* There are notable peaks in Arabica prices around the years 1997, 2022, and 2011 which is the highest on the graph.
* For Robusta, the prices also peaked around 1995 and 2011 but are less pronounced than Arabica's peaks.

### Background
Coffee, a staple in the morning routine of 63% of Americans, is influenced by shifting oceanic patterns. This change raises questions about the fluctuating coffee prices in the top 10 coffee-producing nations. Analyzing global coffee prices extends beyond a single commodity; it offers a window into the complex interaction between economic and environmental dynamics. 

Key factors in growing coffee plants is temperature, rainfall, and elevation:

**Arabica**
* Temp: 73°F – 82°F; does not tolerate heat, does not thrive if temps vary much outside of given range 
* Rainfall: 60-80 inches per year, with a dry period of 2-3 months
* Elevation: 2000-6500 ft
* Very temperamental if weather varies outside of the given ranges

**Robusta**
* Temp: 75.2°F-86°F; is heat tolerant
* Rainfall: 60-80 inches per year, with a dry period of 2-3 months
* Elevation: sea level to 600-1970 ft
* Tougher, hardier plant overall – much more forgiving when weather is outside of the given parameters
### What is El Nino and La Nina?
El Nino and La Nina are part of a natural climatter pattern that occurs in the Pacific Ocean, affecting weather across the globe. 
* **El Nino** happens when **_warm water_** in the Pacific Ocean near the equator moves towards the Americas, changing weather patterns like bringing more rain to some places and causing droughts in others.
* **La Nina** is its opposite; **_cooler waters_** surface in the Pacific, which can lead to drier, warmer weather in some parts of the world and wetter conditions in others.

_When one side is warm, the other is cool, and this influences weather far beyond the Pacific_.
